/* Strings are a null terminated character array. 

for example : 

"hello world \0"

for most fo these tasks you will need to traverse the array
until you find the null character. 

pseudocode for task one

char * str_reverse(char *sourc)
{
	int low = 0, high = 0; 

	traverse the array until the next character is the null character. 
	This will be your null character for example. 

}

char *my_strcpy(char destination, const char *source)
//copy element by element of source into destination 

char *my_strcat( char destination, const char *source)
//find the null byte in destination, from here add 
// source element by element

int my_strcmp(const char * s1, const char * s2)
//this this as a parallel array problem 

in my_strlen(const char * s1)
//increment a counter as you go through
//elements until you reach the null byte 

char array_st[10][50]
strcpy(array_of_strs[1],"item") ;
